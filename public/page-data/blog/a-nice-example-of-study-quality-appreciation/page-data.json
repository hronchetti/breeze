Ha ha ha ha, I laugh at your naivety. Why, I hear you cry, what more could be said?!\n\n‘The GDG considered that there was a substantial body of evidence relating to acupuncture in this review and that further research was unlikely to alter conclusions.'(p.498)\n\nIf the acupuncture literature reviewed was consistently of a very high standard, and / or findings produced were consistent, then the advice to not do any further research would have been appropriate. The main reason we attempt to assess study quality is to gauge the foundations on which to trust the findings (although this is subjective, there exists a general consensus on what could reduce bias in quantitative work). If you have a poor quality (high risk of bias) study, you are less able to wholly trust the findings. Think of it like a black cloaked individual telling you, through extremely noisy breathing apparatus, that the gigantic spherical space station he hangs around in is nowt to worry about. You might take his word for it, but you would probably look for some further corroborative evidence from a source who is not the Supreme Commander of the Empire.","image_description":null,"image":null},{"id":9,"content":"In the LBP guidelines, for acupuncture and manual therapy, the quality range was from high (Jedi) to very low (Emperor Palpatine) (p.497); and most literature for self-management, exercise, CBT, MBR and NSAIDS was moderate (perhaps an early life Anakin) to very low. This provides an insight into the overall quality of research that has been conducted for non-invasive interventions for LBP, and serves to highlight that even for those interventions that were included, the evidence base was rarely considered of the highest caliber. This point alone should stress how important it is to NOT blindly follow the recommendations outlined, as we are far from confident that positive effects observed in the vast majority of interventions were purely down to the intervention being investigated.\n\nHowever, if we are to assume that the panel have excised great care in their assessment of study quality, and that their appraisal is fair, then acupuncture studies are NOT consistently of high quality, and the outcomes of the studies ARE NOT consistent. These two points actually ADVOCATE further study, not recommend halting further research. As with the previous NICE Sham-bles blog, it would seem that some obvious, basic research considerations have been overlooked.","image_description":null,"image":null},{"id":10,"content":"So, the take home messages: the strength of acupuncture literature quality was comparable to all other interventions advocated in the guidelines; those interventions included are done so on a less than secure footing, and; the quality and inconsistency of findings in acupuncture LBP studies indicates MORE work needs to be done, NOT halted.

It therefore comes as no shock to you, avid reader, that my opinions on the NICE LBP guidelines will culminate in this final, third instalment. Please, read over all three blogs and provide feedback, whether it be publicly or privately, as it all goes towards making the world a better place. It has been great to receive encouraging comments thus far, including clinicians using the info to support their practice, and journal editors suggesting its relevance to a wider readership. This one is nice (?!) and short!","id":13},{"content":"In the absence of a study or studies investigating a specific population, guidelines often extrapolate findings from similar, or related, conditions. With the 2016 LBP guidelines, the caveat was that currently, there does not exist a breadth of evidence to cover LBP, and so the panel have considered it appropriate to use the findings of related outcomes in reviewed studies as an appropriate substitute. This is a logical, practical step which is supposed to help clinicians, whilst acknowledging the need to up the game in the research realm. As with the two previous Blog posts (The NICE Sham-bles & A NICE example of study quality consideration) I have yet again used those interventions included in the guidelines to illustrate the gross inconsistencies in the methods in which interventions were included.","id":14},{"content":"So, self-management was recommended because the panel thought it sounded like a good idea (NICE, 2016, p.201). Furthermore, psychological therapies including a cognitive behavioral approach, and manual therapy, were recommended despite the absence of a clinically important improvement in quality of life. In addition, there was sufficient evidence of absence of effect in soft tissue techniques (e.g. massage), and therefore could not be recommended as a standalone intervention: ‘based on the limited clinical benefit seen for mobilisation/manipulation, the Guideline Development Group’s (GDG) felt this form of manual therapy could not be recommended for low back pain or sciatica as an independent intervention.’ (NICE, 2016, p.665). Despite the panel expressing difficulty in being able to state which manual therapy to recommend, they recommend it (and massage) on the proviso that it is in conjunction with other modalities (not stated which). Apologies for stating the obvious, but this is exactly the grounds in which contemporary acupuncture is taught, clinically reasoned and executed; it is rarely, if ever, a stand-alone intervention, and should always be used in conjunction with other modalities.","id":15},{"content":"For NSAIDS, they were recommended for acute low back pain, despite the adverse event profile, and ‘that all the evidence [reviewed for the guideline] was drawn from people with chronic low back pain’ (NICE, 2016, p.665). In addition: ‘The GDG concluded that the potential harms of opioid treatment for chronic low back pain when used as a single agent outweighed the benefits and agreed a recommendation that opioids should not be used in the management of chronic low back pain.’ Yet, weak opioids are recommended when NSAIDS have not worked or are unsuitable. For comparison, here is what they say regarding the findings for acupuncture ‘Where clinically important effects were demonstrated, these were usually short-term.’ (NICE, 2016, p.497). So, acupuncture literature that was reviewed for this guideline, found clinically important short term benefits. Combined with its established extremely low adverse event risk profile, its exclusion for acute flare ups is does not add up.","id":16},{"content":"The point of this short blog post is that the above approaches were considered appropriate to recommend despite several flaws. This seems to be logical in the absence of any stand out approach, but why acupuncture was excluded? The results of nearly every single study into acupuncture for LBP demonstrates it is effective for pain and/or function, regardless of what the proposed independent variable may be. To confound matters, there were studies that were shown to demonstrate a clear benefit compared to verum acupuncture, and as previously posted, a systematic review with meta-analysis by MacPherson et al (2017) demonstrated a clear benefit to receiving acupuncture in chronic pain populations. My hope is that those who make decisions on service provision, give this trilogy of blog posts serious thought. Maintaining a vibrant acupuncture service ensures clinicians can continue with an intervention that has a solid, supportive evidence base, whilst ensuring practitioner autonomy is preserved.","id":17}],"title":"A more logical consideration to NICE"}}]},"imageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAAUABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGQABAAIDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEFAgMG/8QAFAEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP/aAAwDAQACEAMQAAABriTBI03wc6D/xAAbEAABBAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAhAREgAhQf/aAAgBAQABBQLqhU5MEksna6Bv/8QAFBEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIP/aAAgBAwEBPwEf/8QAFBEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIP/aAAgBAgEBPwEf/8QAGRAAAwADAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEQESFx/9oACAEBAAY/AjUzV0c//8QAGhABAAIDAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQARECExQf/aAAgBAQABPyGrBwhh45KmtCADfuNS7sSsNcHH/9oADAMBAAIAAwAAABAzBwD/xAAUEQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAg/9oACAEDAQE/EB//xAAUEQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAg/9oACAECAQE/EB//xAAcEAEBAQACAwEAAAAAAAAAAAABEQAxURAhYXH/2gAIAQEAAT8QAu0qprAVIi3nwajpOLqgk5SB3rkrUCRfuj3rNfzVAi7/2Q==","aspectRatio":1,"src":"/static/8f8cf74098c0ac778849433b8174e8fc/f836f/dr-carl-clarkson.jpg","srcSet":"/static/8f8cf74098c0ac778849433b8174e8fc/2c7f8/dr-carl-clarkson.jpg 50w,\n/static/8f8cf74098c0ac778849433b8174e8fc/86e11/dr-carl-clarkson.jpg 100w,\n/static/8f8cf74098c0ac778849433b8174e8fc/f836f/dr-carl-clarkson.jpg 200w,\n/static/8f8cf74098c0ac778849433b8174e8fc/9dc27/dr-carl-clarkson.jpg 300w,\n/static/8f8cf74098c0ac778849433b8174e8fc/2244e/dr-carl-clarkson.jpg 400w","sizes":"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"Blog-articles_4","next":"Blog-articles_5"}}}
