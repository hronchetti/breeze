In such an event, the delegate will be transferred to the next available course.","question":"Declaration of infectious disease (e.g. COVID-19)","id":1},{"question_answer":"In short, yes! We will continue to follow government guidelines on best practice when it comes to safety and social interactions, and ensure that we are in tandem with the host venue’s own PPE protocols.  \n\nAll essential PPE is provided as part of the course fee.","question":"Is PPE provided on face-to-face courses?","id":2},{"question_answer":"All of our face-to-face courses come with a wealth of online learning, which will prepare you for the contact event. This is essential reading, and the time it takes to complete can vary from course to course. Head to our training platform on Thinkific, and begin your learning journey when it suits you best!  \n\nAll practical elements require delegates to be prepared to act as models – please get in touch with us on enquiries@breeze.academy if you are unable or prefer not to be needled. If you are able to model, please bring with you clothing that allows you to expose all four limbs and the trunk. Rest assured, there will be ample opportunity to change into practical clothing throughout the day.  \n\nAll learning manuals are provided through our online platform and can either be printed prior to attending the face-to-face event or can be used electronically.  \n\nWe will be in touch 2 weeks prior to the course start date with details on directions, transport, and food options.

He holds a PhD, and is an active researcher with several peer-reviewed publications. He has supervised over 20 MSc student projects, and has an ongoing commitment as a primary supervisor to his PhD students.  \n\nDr. Clarkson, founder and chief enthusiast for Breeze academy, continues to be the inspiration and aspiration for those who wish to inspire and embolden humankind. All tutors who provide education for Breeze Academy are experts in their field, and must hold the same passion and enthusiasm for creating exceptional educational content.","question":"What experience does the tutor have?","id":6},{"question_answer":"There are a number of measures we take to assess the quality of teaching throughout all of our courses, primarily through student feedback and external moderators. Our student feedback is gained via in-course surveys, website testimonials, and social media platforms. All comments are thoroughly reviewed and when appropriate, acted upon.\n\nWe feel strongly that in order to maintain our position as a leading training provider, our tutors are aware of what works well and what could be built upon. At the annual review panel, we request that tutors submit a reflective piece outlining how they have acted upon feedback, and what they intend to do in the following year to ensure their courses are of the highest quality. As a result, our tutors consistently have positive feedback and are asked to provide further training on a regular basis.","question":"How is tutor quality assured?","id":9},{"question_answer":"Before any course is advertised, the tutor must submit a lesson plan containing the aims, objectives, and course content. These are reviewed internally for consistency, applicability, and their pedagogical qualities, and are then sent out for external review.\n\nIn line with revalidation approaches adopted for healthcare degrees, all courses that are deemed appropriate will be subject to further quality assurance at 5-year intervals. All tutors are expected to update their courses in light of any related literature published in the interim period to ensure all courses remain evidence-based and within context.","question":"How is course content quality assured?","id":10},{"question_answer":"Although there is a range of courses on offer, you can tailor a CPD event to suit your individual needs.

We also offer consultancy on acupuncture service provision, which we can tailor to suit your clinic’s needs.","question":"Do you provide any clinical support after a course has finished?","id":12},{"question_answer":"Attending an Acuphys training course will equip you with all of the knowledge and skills needed to practice acupuncture safely, confidently and effectively. Healthcare governing bodies such as the HCPC do not stipulate that a practitioner must attend a particular training course, but they do require the individual to have attended and successfully completed training.  \n\nAcuphys foundation courses are a training programme that meets these requirements. Your indemnity insurance to practice acupuncture is usually covered through your professional body (for example a physiotherapist is covered through CSP membership), however it is your responsibility to check your indemnity insurance policy.","question":"Can delegates practice acupuncture after attending Breeze face-to-face course?","id":13},{"question_answer":"Although we strongly recommend that everyone experiences acupuncture, we do not insist upon this. Any individual who does not wish to be needled does not have to disclose this reasons for opting out, and they will not be excluded from any activity. Any health related issues which an individual may have can be discussed in private either prior to or on the course, with full discretion assured.","question":"Must delegates receive acupuncture on Breeze face-to-face course?","id":14},{"question_answer":"All registered health care professionals are eligible to attend our acupuncture courses.
