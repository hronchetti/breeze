Stories, exploration, adventure, scientific study, art – we seek out these experiences, at least in some part, to understand ourselves and the world around us. Our inspirations and aspirations are what drive our species forward; success and failure earn us paralleled benefits, so long as we harness the learning from each event.  \n\nOver a decade ago, I had a simple but ambitious vision – become the inspiration for those who wish to embolden humankind. My personal journey has traversed through successes and failures; a PhD completion, several scientific publications, a globally-orientated training business, a Senior Fellow of the HEA. These are all products of innumerable experiences and interactions, and the conscious and subconscious learning I have taken from them is the reason why our training events have been consistently rated exceptional.
